# Streaming-uUing-Socket
This code work correctly on my notwrk you need only to modify code with your ip addresses 
for the code if you run server.py on the server and client.py on raspberry it will diplay the stream on matplot only on python 
but if you run the server.py on the pc and the directory of thisDirectoryOnRaspberry on raspberry it will diplay the vedio on browser entering 
this ip url http://192.168.1.10:5000/
on the 192.168.1.10 is the ip address of raspberry and 192.168.1.8 is the ip address of pc
